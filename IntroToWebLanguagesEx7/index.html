        This exercise is actually Exercise 1. Exercise 2 is in IntroToWebLanguagesEx1 and Exercise 3 is in IntroToWeblanguagesEx2 and so on until you reach
        IntroToWebLanguagesEx6 which is the repository folder for Exercise 7. Sorry if this was unccessarily confusing. They are just offset by one folder essentially.
